\section{Sources of randomness}
Sources of randomness are crucial for the implementation of \emph{random algorithms}.
Typical applications are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    \item simulation of distributions (i.e. by using a uniform distribution)
    \item cryptographic applications
\end{itemize}
Theoretic analysis of these assumes a \emph{perfectly random} source (usually uniform).
In reality, surces of randomness are \emph{weak} or highly imperfect.
\vocab{Randomness Extractors} aim to shrink the gap between theory and practice;
take as input
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a weak source of randomness satisfying as few assumptions as possible,
    \item a small \emph{truly random} (i.e. truly uniform) seed,
\end{enumerate}
and output an (almost) uniform random variable.

\vocab{Entropy} is a way of measuring \emph{how random} a distribution is.
We shall use it to characterize \emph{weakness} of random sources.
There are different established definitions of entropy.
Notice that for the remainder of this section we denote with $\log$ the binary logarithm $\log_2$
as this is the usual notion in the context of information theory.
\begin{definition}[\vocab{Shannon Entropy}]
    Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a countable set $E$.
    Then we define
    \begin{align*}
        H(\mu) \coloneqq \sum_{x \in E}\mu(x) \cdot \log\left(\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\right)=-\expect{\log(\mu(X))}
    \end{align*}
    (assuming $X \sim \mu$ for the latter version) as the \emph{Shannon entropy}.
\end{definition}
Shannon entropy was originally established in the context of information theory and
tries to quantify information density.
In fact, randomness and information are tightly coupled; generally, the more \emph{random}
an information source is, the less \emph{useful} information it contains;
this is reflected in $H$: the larger its value, the less information (or \emph{structure}) is encoded in $\mu$.
\begin{example}
    Consider $E=\{0,1\}$.
    Intuition says $\mu \sim Ber(\frac{1}{2})$ is the \emph{most random} distribution on $E$.
    If we use Shannon entropy to quantify this intuition, we get
    \begin{align*}
        H(\mu) = \frac{1}{2}\log(2) + \frac{1}{2}\log(2) = \log(2).
    \end{align*}
\end{example}
More generally, for any $E, |E| < \infty$ and $\mu \sim \mathcal U(E)$ we can deduce
\begin{align*}
    H(\mu) = \log(|E|)
\end{align*}
In fact, we can prove that the entropy is maximized in such cases, which adheres to our notion of \emph{most random}.
First, we introduce a helpful result.
\begin{definition}[\vocab{Relative Entropy}]
    Let $\mu, \eta$ be two probability distributions on a countable set $E$.
    Then we define
    \begin{align*}
        H(\mu || \eta) = \sum_{x \in E}\mu(x)\log\left(\frac{\mu(x)}{\eta(x)}\right) = -\expect{\log\left(\frac{\eta(X)}{\mu(X)}\right)}
    \end{align*}
    (assuming $X \sim \mu$ for the latter version) as the \emph{relatie entropy}.
    Literature also refers to it as the \vocab{Kullback-Leibler Divergence}.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma} \label{thm:relent_atleast0}
    The relative entropy satisfies $H(\mu || \eta) \geq 0$ with equality iff $\mu = \eta$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    First, using $X \sim \mu$ and Jensen's inequality (notice $\log$ is strictly concave)
    \begin{align*}
        H(\mu || \eta)  = \sum_{x \in E}\mu(x)\log\left(\frac{\mu(x)}{\eta(x)}\right) \geq -\log\left(\sum_{x \in E}\mu(x)\frac{\eta(x)}{\mu(x)}\right) = -\log(1) = 0.
    \end{align*}
    Equality holds if and only if $\frac{\eta(x)}{\mu(x)}$ are equal for all $x \in E$,
    i.e. $\eta = \mu$.
\end{proof}
Now following result is quite easy to deduce
\begin{theorem}
    Let $E$ be finite.
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $H(\mu)$ is \emph{maximal} if $\mu \sim \mathcal U(E)$. In particular, $H(\mu) = \log(|E|)$.
        \item $H(\mu)$ is \emph{minimal} if $\mu = \delta_x$ for any $x \in E$.
              In particular, $H(\mu) = 0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The second part is trivial since $H(\mu) = 1 \cdot \log(1) = 0$ and $H(\mu) \geq 0$, since
    any finite probability measure $\mu'$ satisfies $0 \leq \mu' \leq 1$.

    For the first part we use relative entropy. Let $\mu$ be any distribution over $E$
    and $\eta \sim \mathcal U(E)$.
    It holds by \autoref{thm:relent_atleast0} that
    \begin{align*}
        0 & \leq H(\mu || \eta) = \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \log\left(\frac{\mu(x)}{\eta(x)}\right)   \\
          & = -\sum_{x \in X}\mu(x) \log (\mu(x)^{-1}) + \sum_{x \in X} \mu(x) \log(\eta(x)^{-1}) \\
          & = -H(\mu) + \log(|E|).
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, $H(\mu) \leq \log(|E|)$ with equality iff $\mu = \eta$.
\end{proof}

Shannon entropy measures the amount of randomess \emph{on average} of a distribution.
However, sometimes we want to consider the \emph{worst case} randomness.
\begin{definition}[\vocab{Min-Entropy}]
    Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a countable set $E$.
    We define the \emph{min-entropy} of $\mu$ as
    \begin{align*}
        H_\infty(\mu) \coloneqq \min_{x \in E}\log\left(\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\right).
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}
Note that $H_\infty(\mu) \geq k$ iff $\mu(x) \leq 2^{-k}$ for all $x\in E$.
So, if $E = \{0,1\}^k$, the uniform distribution clearly has the largest min-entropy.

Turning back to our random number generation,
suppose we want to build a seed-less extractor
that takes as input any random variable on $\{0,1\}^n$
and should output $\mathcal U(\{0,1\})$.
Assume that our input $X$ satisfies the rather strict condition
\begin{align} \label{eq:naive_extractor_req}
    H_\infty(X) \geq n-1,
\end{align}
i.e. no bitstring occurs with probability higher than $2^{n-1}$.
Therefore, any generator function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ must satisfy one of
\begin{align*}
    |\{x \in \{0,1\}^n \mid f(x)=b\}| \geq 2^{n-1}
\end{align*}
for $b \in \{0,1\}$.
We now try to construct an adversary input variable:
Let $A_b$ be the set of inputs mapping to the same output that satisfies previous requirement,
and let $Y \sim \mathcal U(A_b)$.
Then $H_\infty(Y) \geq n-1$ since $f(A_b) = b$ and $|A_b| \geq 2^{n-1}$,
which shows that even with a quite strict condition we cannot construct a seedless generator.
